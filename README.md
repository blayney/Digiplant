# Digiplant
Rule over your garden with an iron fist (or watering can)

Digiplant is an app that lets you manage your plants. It lets you create watering schedules, and in theory allows you to connect RFID tags to plant pots and scan the plant when it has been watered, allowing the app to remind you which plants need watering given their plant type and the date since last water.
